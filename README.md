chipping_model_simple_lattice
=============================

My undergraduate thesis looked at the phase transitions exhibited in a chipping model, a stochastic model of aggregation, diffusion, and chipping, on a simple lattice.  This code takes a set of probabilities and applies them to a mass distribution along a simple lattice, aiming to measure the correlation function between masses.  By numerically measuring the correlation function, a match to the theory can be recovered.  The correlation function is used to identify the phase transition from a fluid phase (a homogenous distribution) to a condensate phase consisting of a significant cluster of mass.
